# **Retail Store Analysis Project**

## **Project Summary**

This project aims to analyze and visualize data from an online retail store to support decision-making for the CEO and CMO. The analysis focuses on understanding revenue patterns, customer behavior, and product demand to develop an effective expansion strategy. Insights are presented through interactive dashboards using **Power BI**.

## **Objective**

The project addresses four key questions posed by the executives:

1. **Monthly Revenue Trends (2011)**: Identify seasonal trends in revenue to assist the CEO in forecasting future performance.
2. **Top 10 Revenue-Generating Countries (Excluding the UK)**: Highlight the most profitable markets for international operations to guide the CMO.
3. **Top 10 Customers by Revenue**: Help the CMO focus on retaining high-value customers by identifying the biggest contributors to revenue.
4. **Product Demand by Region (Excluding the UK)**: Provide the CEO with an overview of demand distribution across countries to target high-potential regions for expansion.

## **Process Overview**

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
Before any analysis, the dataset is cleaned to ensure accurate results:
- **Invalid Quantities**: Removed rows where quantities are less than 1.
- **Erroneous Unit Prices**: Excluded rows where unit prices are $0 or negative.
- The cleaned dataset serves as the foundation for accurate analysis and visualization.

### 2. **Visualizations**
Each question is answered using a specific visualization technique:
- **Question 1**: **Line Chart** for monthly revenue trends in 2011.
- **Question 2**: **Bar Chart with Dual Axis** to show top 10 countries by revenue and quantities sold.
- **Question 3**: **Horizontal Bar Chart** displaying the top 10 customers by revenue, sorted in descending order.
- **Question 4**: **Map Visualization** illustrating product demand by region, with countries outside the UK highlighted.

### 3. **Tools Used**
- Data Cleaning: **Power Query** (Power BI) or **Data Prep** (Tableau).
- Visualizations: **Power BI** or **Tableau** dashboards.
- Formats: Tableau (.twbx) or Power BI (.pbix).
